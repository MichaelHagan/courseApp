# courseApp
CourseApp is a grade point average (gpa) and cumulative grade point average(cgpa) monitoring app. It is used to calculate gpa and cgpa as per courses added.
The app can be used to make projections for a semester. Courses for a semester can be added from which its grades can be altered to check how it affects the final cgpa. Users can use this to know the grade needed, for each course, to achieve a target cgpa. The app utilizes an offline database making records saved accessible upon reopening the app. The offline database together with a user-friendly UI, makes the app fast and easy to use.
Hope you enjoy the app!
